# 🕸️ Welcome to SynSwarm DAO

**The Decentralized Infrastructure for the Post-Search Era.**

Traditional SEO is dead. The future of web traffic is dictated by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI engines like SearchGPT, Perplexity, and Claude. 
**SynSwarm DAO** is an open-source collective dedicated to building the ultimate semantic routing and Edge-compute protocols to optimize how AI ingestion pipelines read the web.

## 🌌 The SynSwarm Ecosystem

We maintain a strict separation between our open-source protocol and enterprise implementations to ensure both innovation and commercial SLA reliability.

* **[1] The Open Protocol**: The `synswarm-protocol` provides the core Edge Proxy interception and JSON-LD/Markdown hybrid rewriting mechanisms.
* **[2] Geodex Global HQ**: The official, enterprise-grade GUI and SaaS platform built on SynSwarm. Serving global Fortune 500 brands with Proprietary GEO Scoring™ and Omni-Model Telemetry. 👉 [geodex.cn](https://www.geodex.cn)
